<h1>Paginate.js</h1>

<p>Paginate.js transforms an absurdly long, boring list into an organized group of items with letter pagination. Supported lists include unordered lists and lists nested/wrapped inside any elements including divs.</p>

<p>See <strong><a href="projects.techtalkshq.com/paginate-js/">demos and examples</a></strong>.</p>
